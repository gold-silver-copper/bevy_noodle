//! A minimal, headless node graph library for Bevy UI: you build and style the
//! nodes and edges, it handles the graph.
//!
//! ```text
//! NodeCanvas              your UI node: one graph and its viewport (no background)
//! └── CanvasContent       spawned by the canvas; pans and zooms, holds the nodes
//!     └── GraphNode       your UI node, styled however you like
//!         └── … Port      your UI node marking a connection point
//!
//! Edge                    spawned on connect, outside the hierarchy: its
//!                         EdgeSource/EdgeTarget ports decide its graph
//! ```
//!
//! Spawn nodes as children of a canvas; they move into its content. Any
//! number of canvases can coexist or nest; every lookup resolves to the
//! nearest one. Read graphs with [`GraphQuery`], change them with
//! [`GraphCommandsExt::graph_edit`], and select with
//! [`GraphCommandsExt::select`]. Interaction is opt-in per canvas with
//! [`CanvasInteraction`]. The core draws nothing: draw edges from
//! [`EdgeGeometry`], or enable the `default_style` feature. The `scene`
//! feature adds graph snapshots (undo, save and load).
//!
//! Events follow one rule. What observers answer is only triggered on the
//! canvas: [`ConnectionCheck`] (connection rules, also asked by previews) and
//! [`EditRequested`] (rewrite or veto an edit about to apply). What happened
//! is triggered on the canvas and also written as a message, for observers
//! and systems alike: [`EditApplied`], [`EditRejected`] and [`WireDropped`].
//! Selection is Bevy's `Selected` component: observe its `Add` and `Remove`.

// Bevy's `AsBindGroup` derive trips a recursion lint on recent compilers.
